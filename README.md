# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - Lisp

_SICP is a very well known text teaching the conceptual basis of programming_.

A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer’s idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched.
It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can
answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm
in a factory.
