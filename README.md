# Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs - Lisp

_SICP is a very well known text teaching the conceptual basis of programming_...

A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer’s idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched.

answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm
in a factory.
