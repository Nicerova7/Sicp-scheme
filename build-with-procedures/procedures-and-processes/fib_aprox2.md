![1](https://github.com/Nicerova7/Sicp-scheme/blob/master/img/1.jpg)


_Proof_: 

We will use a Ross Honsberger lemma from the book [Mathematical Gems](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ISBN=0883853019/ctksoftwareincA/)

__Lema__

![3](https://github.com/Nicerova7/Sicp-scheme/blob/master/img/3.jpg)

_k=1_

![4](https://github.com/Nicerova7/Sicp-scheme/blob/master/img/4.jpg)


_k=2_

![5](https://github.com/Nicerova7/Sicp-scheme/blob/master/img/5.jpg)

_k=n_
```	
It is assumed that
```

Then we  have to reach k = n+1
From (1) multiplied by x

	then , the inducction is concluyed
